# Amazon Webpage Project

This project is a basic representation of an Amazon-like e-commerce webpage. It consists of a simple HTML page styled with CSS, showcasing product listings with an "Add to Cart" button. The structure and design are implemented using HTML5 and CSS3.

## Files

- **amazon.html**: The main HTML file for the webpage, which includes:
  - A header section with the Amazon logo and a navigation menu.
  - A welcome section introducing the site.
  - Featured products displayed in a grid format.
  - A footer for navigation back to the top of the page.

- **amazonstyle.css**: The stylesheet used to style the HTML page. Key styles include:
  - **Body and Layout**: Font styles, margins, and padding to create a clean layout.
  - **Header and Navigation**: Styled with a dark background and white text.
  - **Product Grid**: A responsive grid layout for displaying the products.
  - **Buttons**: Custom styling for the "Add to Cart" button.

## Features

- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Products are displayed using CSS Grid, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Custom Buttons**: Styled buttons for user interaction, such as adding items to the cart.
- **Consistent Design**: The design maintains a clean and consistent style with Amazon's typical color scheme of dark blue (#232f3e) and gold for action buttons.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `amazon.html` file in a browser to view the webpage.
3. The CSS file (`amazonstyle.css`) is linked directly in the HTML file, so no additional setup is required.

## Future Improvements

- Implement JavaScript functionality for adding items to the cart and managing cart content.
- Integrate a real product database and dynamic product rendering.
- Enhance the design with animations and hover effects.
